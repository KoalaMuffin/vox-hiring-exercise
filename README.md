- Have a consistent design
- Not take longer than a couple hours to make it work
- Provide all the code you used to create your final product, including
instructions on how to view the final output, if necessary
- Be prepared to present and explain your work and decisions
- Submit your solution as a zip file or something via email

Do not:

- Copy the [original piece](https://www.vox.com/world/2017/11/27/16670950/trump-russia-timeline)
- Fork this repo
- Publish your solution in a public place
- Spend too much time on this!

You can, if you wish:

- Ask questions about any aspect of this code or requirements
- Change the build script and templates
- Use different tools than the included ruby build script and template (be mindful of your time)
- Use other peoples code (as long as licenses allow it!)
- Structure files however you like

Do not worry about:

- Adhering to Vox style in fonts, colors, typography
- Making it work for large screens/desktop browsers, or other browsers/devices
